# Nija Trading Bot
# This is a Coinbase trading bot using `coinbase_advanced_py`.
# It is designed to run as a Render Background Worker.
#
# Setup:
# 1. Add environment variables in Render:
#    - API_KEY → Coinbase API key
#    - API_SECRET → Coinbase secret
#    - LIVE_TRADING → False or True
#
# 2. Deploy as a Worker service.
# 3. The bot will automatically start, self-heal on crashes, and log prices.
#
# ✅ No ports needed → green checks appear automatically.
